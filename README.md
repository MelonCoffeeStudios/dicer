=====

Dicer is a dice rolling RPG. 

I have decided to create a browser based version of the popular Andriod app "Tiny Dice Dungeon".

So far it is very WIP but I'm adding to it rather quickly :D

Installation
------

1) Just download that .zip foo. 
2) Extract it where you want. 
3) Open that index.html brah.
3.5) If things don't work, now would be a good time to mention that you require internet for jQuery n stuff.
4) Laugh at my poor attempt of a game.
5) Profit????
